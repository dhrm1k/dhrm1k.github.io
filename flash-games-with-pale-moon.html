	<h3>Run Flash in browser to play games.</h3>

	
	All the major browsers have dropped support for Adobe Flash. But believe it or not, flash games were the best.
	If you want to still play good ol' flash games, I've found a way. There's this browser called Pale Moon that has not dropped support for Adobe Flash Player. <br><br>

	You can download Pale Moon from <a href="https://www.palemoon.org/download.shtml">here</a>. You will also need to download Adobe Flash Player from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200630185339/https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/archived-flash-player-versions.html">here</a>. I'd recommend the one titled <code>(Released 5/12/2020) Flash Player 32.0.0.371 (425 MB)</code>.<br><br>

	Doing this will let you play the games of the golden era. Trust me those bad boys make you engrossed in them for hours. <br><br>

	I really liked Pale Moon's mottoâ€”<b><i>"Your browser, Your way"</i></b>.
