i was introduced to the greatest text editor, vim, a long time ago in 9th grade, but i wasn’t as acquainted with it then as i am now. i created a plugin/script in vimscript for new users who want to use vim as an alternative to all the data-hoarding ai tools out there. it provides help with shortcuts, just like nano, in a buffer. here’s the link to the project: <a href="https://github.com/dhrm1k/hello-vim">hello.vim</a>
