<p>
ever wondered what it would be like to search your own memories with natural language? like, "show me the time i went to that concert in 2019" or "what was that book i read about philosophy last year"? well, that's what this project is all about.

i’ve always kept random notes in plain text files. some are diary entries, some are quick thoughts. but when i wanted to find them later, i’d end up grepping through dozens of files, guessing keywords.
i wondered: what if my computer could understand my notes the way i do? instead of searching for the exact word “grandma,” i could just ask:
“who did i meet?”
…and it would find the answer.

it doesn't use open ai's models or any closed model, it rather uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2. when coming to question of hardware requirements, it runs on my computer, but mine is an unconventional setup with 32 gigs of ram. i read this stackoverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76618655/hardware-requirements-for-using-sentence-transformers-all-minilm-l6-v2">post</a> that said it can run on 2 gigs dockerized but i have no idea on benefits of dockerizing on memory requirements. i will run it and update here later.
