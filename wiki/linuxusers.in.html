<p>
i love text-first social networks. the idea of the fediverse has always excited me. you can be a fan of facebook-like networking based on the concept of friend requests and still interact with the profile i have on pixelfed, which is used for photo sharing.
</p>

<p>
the first instance on the fediverse that i was on was mathstodon.xyz, later emacs.sh (rip), and then i still have an account on fosstodon.org. amidst all this, i came across a minimalistic activitypub instance written in c. from all i know, it can also be run on 512mb of ram. it's called snac. 
</p>

<p>
i host it and am the proud admin of the instance. it's on linuxusers.in. my friends and i use it.
</p>

<p>
here's link to the instance: <a href="https://linuxusers.in">linuxusers.in</a>
