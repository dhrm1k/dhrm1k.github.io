<p>
i love text-first social networks. the idea of the fediverse has always excited me. you can be a fan of facebook-like networking based on the concept of friend requests and still interact with the profile i have on pixelfed, which is used for photo sharing.
</p>

<p>
the first instance on the fediverse that i was on was mathstodon.xyz, later emacs.sh (rip), and then i still have an account on fosstodon.org. amidst all this, i came across a minimalistic activitypub instance written in c. from all i know, it can also be run on 512mb of ram. it's called snac. 
</p>

<p>
i host it and am the proud admin of the instance. it's on linuxusers.in. my friends and i use it.
</p>

<p>
here's link to the instance: <a href="https://linuxusers.in">linuxusers.in</a>
</p>

<p>
update 1: incase you are a user or not comfortable with the default web ui of snac, we also host <a href="https://phanpy.linuxusers.in">phanpy.social</a> for our users.
</p>

<p>
update 2: the TUI client everyone uses for mastodon is <a href="https://github.com/ihabunek/toot">toot</a>. though the problem is that toot is not compatible with snac. for that reason i have wrote my own terminal client for snac. it's currently usable. you can post from it. though the sad part is that currently you need to go through the code to configure it (i mean to say to understand it better or set it up). i will make it better as the time goes. link to the <a href="https://github.com/dhrm1k/snac.py">snac.py</a> repository.
</p>

<p>
update 3: well, now you can login and post to your snac account from toot.py too. here's more info from the <a href="https://github.com/ihabunek/toot/issues/523">github</a> issue.
