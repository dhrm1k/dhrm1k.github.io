<div id="expense tracker"><h2 id="expense tracker" class="header"><a href="#expense tracker">expense tracker</a></h2></div>

<p>
i made a expense tracker (i call it expense base). it's built with tkinter and uses sqlite for database. well, just like everyone else i too don't like the widgets tkinter gives by default. recently, i did learn that there's something called custom tkinter that gives more modern looking widgets.
</p>

<p>
i wanted a solution asap so i used tkinter. i have also released a .exe for anyone on windows to download. the code and release is on <a href="https://github.com/dhrm1k/ExpenseBase">github</a>.
