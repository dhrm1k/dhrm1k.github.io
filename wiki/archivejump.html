i recently finished building a browser extension called <a href="https://github.com/dhrm1k/ArchiveJump">archivejump</a>. i have always been a reader on the web, and for all the years of life i have lived, i have always been a student and ofcourse not have been able to afford to pay for subscription of all the newspapers i read on the internet. so, i built this extension to help me access the archived versions of articles when paywalls get in the way.

<p>
why do you need an extension when you can just use the wayback machine/archive.today? well, for me i am a big multitasker, i do multiple things at once. i open an article and when i see that it has a paywall, i sometimes forget to read it entirely and then i see it after days/weeks when i close all the tabs. so, i built this extension to help me access the archived versions of articles when paywalls get in the way right on the moment.

the reaction to this project has been overwhelmingly positive. firstly, i posted it on reddit and got around 9.7k views in r/opensource and lot of upvotes. the github repo has seen around 13 stars, which is my highest ever. i can also see around 50+ git clones. later, i added it to mozilla firefox add-ons and it got approved. i haven't yet added it to	 chrome web store (that god'damn one time developer fee).

<p>
you can add it to your browser if you are mozilla <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/archivejump/">firefox</a> user and here's the link to <a href="https://github.com/dhrm1k/ArchiveJump">github</a> with instructions to manually install it.
