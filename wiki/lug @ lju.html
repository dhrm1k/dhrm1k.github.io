<p>
for as long as i can remember, i’ve been sparkleyed by foss—trying different distros, self-hosting things, breaking stuff, and putting it back together. just yesterday, i set up immich on my own server.
</p>

<p>
starting this linux users group at my college because there’s no better time to bring together people who love linux, open-source, and everything in between. whether you’re deep into it or just curious, you’re welcome here.
</p>

<p>
here's the link to the website <a href="https://dhrm1k.github.io/lju-lug/ ">lug @ lju</a>.
</p>

<p>
if you arrived here and the above interested you then the next thing you might want to look into is <a href="linuxusers.in.html">snac instance</a> i host for friends.
</p>

<p>
i have links to the whatsapp group and discord server on the website. if you’re someone like us, let’s talk.
</p>

<p>
edit recently: i expected it to be big. it’s not. it’s just a few of us, but we’re having fun. i’m learning a lot about how to run a group like this, and i’m excited to see where it goes.
