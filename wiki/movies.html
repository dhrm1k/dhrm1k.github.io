<p>
i do watch a good amount of movies. i have never been interested in web series or shows for most part. i have watched a few, but for most part i stay away from it, because i lack the patience to go on for 2-3 seasons (most of times shows are longer than this) to see what happens.

<p>
the genre of movies i like the most is adventure. on a day when i feel like doing nothing and just want something to go in the back, because i am preoccupied by something else, i watch feel-good movies where i know the ending is going to be a happy one.
