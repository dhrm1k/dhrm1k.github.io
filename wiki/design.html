<p>
design can be everywhere. i particularly here talk in context of user interfaces and user experience.

i like good design. i respect those who understand design and the art of what looks good and what won't. what is simple and what will people enjoy to use. i don't think i have that ability to judge when it comes to what will look good visually to everyone when i am the one designing it.
