	<h3>Found a letter</h3>

In the month of July, I and Rahul visited a book fair. After the fair, we went to have a milkshake and were thrilled to find a letter apparently dated February 16 tucked inside the pages of The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins. We thought it was the 16th of January, but we were wrong. I already posted it on X, but found it interesting enough to dedicate a blog post to it.

Rahul took the trouble to digitize the letter in a Google Doc for others to read. Hereâ€™s the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wuADZoLhhHLRwKebREuBAPmcx8cCSCw6KVOZSaROqm8">link</a, to it.
